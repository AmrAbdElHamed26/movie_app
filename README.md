# Movie App

The Movie App is a Flutter project with a strong foundation in Clean Architecture and leveraging RESTful APIs to ensure efficient data handling and minimize response costs. Additionally, we've integrated the powerful third-party library, jitsi_meet_flutter_sdk, to create dynamic screening rooms where numerous viewers can simultaneously enjoy the same film.
